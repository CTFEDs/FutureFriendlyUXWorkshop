# Facilitator feedback: one thing we could do differently

* Would have liked more theory and less practical application. Whilst I realise people learn best while doing, I feel the workshop was little light on content. Nice vibe created by Justin and Steve!
* Presentation was fun, activities a bit too much =). Overall, I had fun. Good job! Thanks.
* Less breaks. Wire framing 101. Prototyping tools used (Azure)
* Slightly more theory at start of workshop instead of only at the end.
* More information on how to use principles. e,g, analyse current sites. lots of interaction which was great.
* A little more theory and lectures to help kickstart the practical session. Maybe more examples before and after etc. More case studies.
* Too many breaks = no momentum.
* Ask us to Prep a problem beforehand, which we'll have the session to work on.
* Session objective could've been shared way ahead of time. Discussion sessions can be made shorter. There was some awkward silence due to long session / top much time. Overall, great session! :)
* Agenda with some background information to guide the process... maybe.
* State and explain the objectives pf each exercises more clearly.
* Elaborate more on required tasks. Maybe give examples when explaining requirements. Otherwise the workshop was fantastic. Fun and different!
* Be clearer on the tasks :)
* Goodie bags? Be experts first: show us examples and prove yourselves. Explain yourselves and the training and the exercises.
* Good workshop! Maybe slightly elaborate on the problems, patterns, and principles exercise that was done at the front.
* I'm not sure if you've seen this, but give "the user is drunk" a look (it's a website with a short video). Thank you for a great workshop. Thoroughly enjoyed.
* Give more concrete examples during the theory section of the presentation.
* Please add more examples (visual: pictures and videos). Everything was limited to text and mental concepts. I would have enjoyed more substance, maybe use cases.
