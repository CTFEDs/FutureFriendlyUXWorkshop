# Goals

* Identify your specific **Problems** and **Patterns**.
* Make your own list of Future Friendly UX **Principles**.
* Start sketching out **Solutions**.

## Warm-up exercise

* What was the first thing you worked on?
* What changes in the tech landscape have there been since then?

## Arriving

* **Turn and talk**: share your warm-up answers. Write down other people's answers on sticky notes and take them back to your table.

## 1:00 pm

* **Table talk** (15m): on big bits of paper, write down changes in the tech landscape in the past few years. Guidelines will be up on the wall, to be revealed later.
* **Presentation** (15m): Future Friendly User Experience.
* **Discussion** (30m): we'll look at some popular Patterns (A4 prints, stuck up on the wall) and discuss what Problems they might have (what assumptions are we making?) and what Principles we might apply to fix them.

## 2:00 pm

* **Gallery Walk** (30m): walk around the room and write on the posters (each one has some samples).
  * Problems from the Table Talk.
  * Patterns from the Table Talk.
  * Future Friendly principles from the Presentation.

## 2:30 pm

* **Summarise** (25m): make summaries of the posters for your table. One person at your table will share with the rest of the room: one sentence each about your summary of the Problems, Patterns, and Principles posters.

## Break (5m)

* Write any questions you have up on the "Questions" poster. We'll discuss them right after the break.

## Questions

* **Discussion** (5m): questions on the poster.

## 3:00 pm

### Sketch your Future Friendly UX Solutions

### Diverge

* **Pick a Pattern to work on** (5m). This could be from the discussion, or something else from your own work that you'd like to improve. Identify the Problems with it.
* **Sketch out lots of ideas for Solutions** (15m), thinking about the Principles you need to apply. Focus on **quantity** rather than **quality**.
* **Discussion** (5m): questions on the poster.
* **Dote Vote** (10m). Grab a pen and stand up.
  * Move one seat to your left.
  * Add a dot on your favourite idea.
  * Repeat until you're back at your own seat.
* **Table share** (15m). Tell the table about your pattern, the solution with the most votes, and which Future Friendly Principles you're using. Use one sentence for each.

## 3:50 pm

## Break (10m)

* Write any questions you have up on the "Questions" poster. We'll discuss them right after the break.

## 4pm

### Converge

* **Sketch** (10m): iterate on your most-voted idea.

## Leaving

* **Card Exchange: SMART goal** (10m): find a buddy. On the front of a card, write down a SMART goal. On the back of it, write down your contact details. Swap your card with your buddy's.
* **Facilitator Feedback** (5m): on and index card, write down **one thing we could do differently next time**.
* **Handout**: pick up a copy of the Problems, Patterns, Principles, Solutions handout on your way out.
