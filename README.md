# Future Friendly UX Workshop

> Outline for a Future Friendly UX Workshop

The big idea: look at improving some common design patterns that are usually implemented in a way that isn't very friendly to Progressive Enhancement or Front-end Performance.

One of the reasons to do a workshop rather than a talk is to get more face-to-face time with the presenter(s). We think about 20 people feels right for a 4 hour workshop.

## Title

Future Friendly UX design

## Describe your talk in approximately 300 characters

We'll look at what Future Friendly UX design is, then at:

* the Problems that face us;
* what Patterns we use that aren't so Future Friendly
* which Future Friendly UX Principles we can apply to make things better;
* what Solutions can we use.

The workshop will be very interactive, so expect to do lots of talking, lots of writing, and lots of sketching. We'll do most activities in small groups at tables, but share all our work with everyone. Yes, there will be plenty of sticky notes! We'll end with setting yourself a SMART goal that you'll share with a buddy, to help both of you achieve your goal.

(This is an updated version of the workshop that ran in [November 2015](http://www.uxsouthafrica.com/conference/cape-town-2015))

## Why is this a good topic?

Attendees will leave with practical tips and techniques for making their designs more Future (and User) Friendly.

## Any comments, questions or requirements?

We'll need a projector, and lots of pen, paper, and sticky notes. Please!
